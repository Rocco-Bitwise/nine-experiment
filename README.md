# 9 Experiment: Peace Through Science

These are the original SWF files for *9 Experiment* retrieved from archived copies of *9experiment.com*.

Almost all assets including images, audio and scripts required for the game to work are included. Unfortunately, two of the minigames (Talisman and Keepsake) and some concept art and journal entries were unable to be found and are still lost.

Instructions

> 1. Download the file and unzip it (I'd recommend 7-Zip for this process).
> 2. Download the flash player projector from archive.org.
> 3. Open up "flashplayer_32_sa.exe" and go to "File > Open".
> 4. Go to the "9_experiment_full_game" folder and open "nine_site.swf" or "nine_loader.swf".

If you've done everything correctly, the SWF files should run as intended. If you experience any issues or have any questions then contact me on Discord (Rocco#3471).
